If you have trouble falling asleep, or waking up in the night, try two techniques:

- Quarter of an Hour Rule
    - If you are awake in bed for approximately 15 min, instead of remaining in bed, tossing and turning, get out of bed and do something quiet and relaxing. Only return to bed when you are feeling sleepy.
- Progressive Muscle Relaxation
    - Practice slow breathing while tensing each muscle group in your body and then releasing it, starting with your toes/feet, and moving up your body gradually to your head/face.
