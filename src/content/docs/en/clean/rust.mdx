# RustRover

## Set Toolchain location

- Settings → Rust → Toolchain location → `/Users/vamsisatti/.nix-profile/bin`

## Set standard library

First, you must ensure that your `rustup`-managed toolchain has the standard library source code installed. This is done by adding the `rust-src` component.

```sh frame="none"
rustup component add rust-src
```

The standard library source code is located within your toolchain's "sysroot" directory. You can find this path programmatically.

```
echo "$(rustc --print sysroot)/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library"
```

This command does two things:
1.  `rustc --print sysroot`: This asks the Rust compiler to print the root directory of the currently active toolchain. In a Nix environment, this will be a long path starting with `/nix/store/...`.
2.  `echo ".../lib/rustlib/src/rust/library"`: This appends the standard sub-path where the source code lives.

**This is the exact path you need to give to RustRover.** Copy this entire line.

- Settings → Rust → Standard library → `/Users/vamsisatti/.rustup/toolchains/stable-aarch64-apple-darwin/lib/rustlib/src/rust`
