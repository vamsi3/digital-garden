##### Cabs

##### Translation

- Don't use chinese apps. Just use Google Translate / LLMs. This was written in 2025, probably the future is much brigher.

For Metro, buses etc (each city has it's own card that you can create from these apps)

- WeChat
- Alipay

For inter-city trains

- Railway 12306 (App exists; and probably also website exists?)
